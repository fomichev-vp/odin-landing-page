# odin-landing-page
An exercise for theodinproject.com.
I am making a landing page according to an example given in the task.
I have to use flex-box and other simple instruments in order to practice and repeat what I have learned so far.

I really want myself to become better. And in the future I will be thanking myself for not giving up.
These exercises may look simple for professionals or somebody that has already acquired a job they wanted.
But that's hard for me. Especially continueing and not stopping when something doesn't work out.

I hope someday I can look back on my work and say: "That was worth it".
